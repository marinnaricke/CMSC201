Question 1:
1. Write down all the numbers between 1 and 7.
2. Divide 7 by each number starting with the number 1.
3. Record the outcome of each division including the remainder.
4. Isolate the outcomes that have a remainder of zero.
5. If 7 divided by 1 is the only outcome that has a remainder of zero, then 7
   is a prime number.
6. If 7 divided by 1 is not the only outcome that has a remainder of zero,
   then 7 is not prime.

Question 2:
1. Write down all the numbers between 1 and the given number.
2. Divide the given number by each number starting with 1.
3. Record the outcome of each division including the remainder.
4. Isolate the outcomes that have a remainder of zero.
5. If the given number divided by 1 is the only outcome that has a reaminder
   of zero, the given number is a prime.
6. If step 5 is false, the given number is not prime.

Question 3:
1. Compare the first letter with the last letter of the word.
2. If the two letters are the same, continue to step 3. If different, the word
   is not a palindrome.
3. Compare the second letter with the second to last letter of the word.
4. If the two letters are the same, continue to step 4.
5. Continue comparing letters until you reach the center of the word.
6. If all the letters are the same, the word is a palindrome.

Question 4:
1. View the first notecard in the stack.
2. Set this first notecard to the left of the main stack.
3. View the next notecard in the main stack.
4. If the number on this notecard is higher then the previous, set this
   notecard on the stack to the left.
5. If step 4 is false, set the card to the right of the main stack.
5. Repeat steps 3 through 5 until all the cards in the main stack are gone.
6. The card with the highest number is on the top of the left stack.

Question 5:
1. Write down the number you are given.
2. Write down the given number and all the numbers before it including 1.
3. Multiply all the numbers between 1 and the given number.
4. The product of the numbers is the factorial.
